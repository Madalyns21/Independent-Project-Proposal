# Independent-Project-Proposal
<html>
 
<h2>Title: Madalyn's Online Portfolio</h2>
    
<h3>Overview (Scope of Work):</h3>
<p>I would like to create a portfolio page using bootstrap and flex box. Using these will help me further my understanding with CSS and to create a better portfolio page. I plan to create a wireframe using either Axure or Adobe XD. Then I would like to create a Front-End Template using Bootstrap 4. I would also like to focus on user interface design while creating my page. I want it to be very efficient and straightforward of its purpose and how the page works, while having some creative elements to show off. The audience would be anyone who wants to know more about me or for employers that would like to see my real-life work.</p>

<h3>Goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To make a user friendly site for all audience to use and browse through</li>
        <li>To display myself and to show off the work I have created</li>
        <li>To have a portfolio where employers can look at my work to potentially hire me</li>
    
   
    
    
<h3>Audience:</h3>
    <p>The audience for my independent project would be anyone who is intrested to get to know me and my professional career path or if any employer needs to see my work in one concise spot.</p>
    
    
<h3>Timeline:</h3>
<p>I am going to do my research on bootstrap and flex box first since those programs and techniques I have the least experience with. Then I want to start designing my page on Adobe XD to get a nice layout. The next step would be actually coding the page and experimenting with my new techniques I learned.
